# Timo's Nap Game

A fun web game where you help Timo sleep peacefully by defending against annoying enemies!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## iOS Audio Support

The game includes special handling for iOS Safari's strict audio policies:

- Audio is initially muted and enabled on first user interaction
- Visual audio status indicator shows when audio is enabled
- Manual audio enable button available if needed
- Web Audio API context initialization for better compatibility

If audio doesn't work on iOS, tap the ðŸ”Š icon in the game UI to manually enable it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
